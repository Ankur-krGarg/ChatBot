## 🚀 Features

- **Conversational AI**  
  Real-time interaction using pre-trained transformer models.

- **Plug-and-Play**  
  Minimal setup with Hugging Face’s pipeline interface.

- **Customizable Response Logic**  
  Simple rules integrated with model outputs for better user experience.

- **Scalable Base**  
  Ready to be extended into more advanced systems (like RAG or agent-based bots).
